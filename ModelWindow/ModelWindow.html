      <h1>Thought for the day 😍</h1>
      <h4>
        I have learned over the years that when one’s mind is made up, this
        diminishes fear.One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually
        listening to what another has to say.Don’t tell people how to do things;
        tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.
